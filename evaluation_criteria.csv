Evaluation Criteria (EC),Questions answered,Indicators,Scoring 
(EC1) Integrated data aggregation and advocacy grade visualizations,"What type of data can be collected (text, photos, documents, audio,...)? Can data be visualized and explored (maps, charts, dashboards, filtering,…) What support is given to analyze and use data (generated reports, data export options,...)?","EC1.1 (required) Supports >= 3 (text, photos/videos, documents, audio,...)



",Yes = EC1 .1 and (any 2 of EC1.2–EC1.4)

(EC2) Resilient and structured field capture,"How is data captured (mobile apps, forms, surveys,...)? Are there data validation techniques? Is data capture possible in low connectivity or offline
environments (queuing, syncing,…)?","EC2.1 (required) offline capture of forms/media with queue/sync upload once online
