General Principles Missing ,Limitations and things I am missing 
 Inclusive co-design & end-user involvement,"“A concerning observation was that in only 15% of the studies were the intended end users of the apps consulted during app development.” (Andrachuk et al., 2019, p. 436) "
,"“Participant centered design (or user-centered design in the context of mobile apps development in general) helps reach and involve participants by involving them throughout the entire process, from concept—to design—to iterative user-testing to shared outcomes. The early involvement of participants helps unearth issues such as ergonomic factors and how to support the learning curve before final user testing takes place.” (Luna et al. 2018, p. 17)"
,"“Citizen science projects that propose to reach out to audiences with low science capital, should conduct user-profiling to understand who is likely to use the mobile application, and in what context.” (Luna et al., 2018, p. 20)"
,"Community organization features such as ""Enable communication between participants"" and ""Enable communication between participants and researchers"" were identified as key design dimensions in digital CS (Stein et al. 2023, p. 3)"
,"“A forum should be provided as separate menu item to support volunteers collate and respond to feedback, offer their suggestions and support, as well as for social interaction purposes...Similarly, a help page should be provided as a separate menu item” (Skarlatidou et al., 2019, p. 12)"
,"Support information features such as ""Provide separate support pages"" and  ""Provide interactive tutorials and  information"" were identified as key design dimensions in the digital CS literature (Stein et al. 2023, p.3)"
Inclusive technical entry and use options,"“Research participants frequently noted that many civil society documenters do not have access to smartphones and cameras, and/or do not have the capacity to use this technology.” (PLIPG et al. 2020, p. 49)"
,"“Furthermore, the unequal access to technology by all segments of society may also skew not only the focus on who is represented in online content, but also the types of violations that are available online, in particular with regard to user-generated content.” (United Nations et al. 2022, p. 46)"
,"“With many of the tools considered, organizations have the option to set up their own server; this, however, requires a certain level of technical knowledge and skill.” (PLIPG et al. 2020, p. 63)"
Risk-aware publishing & consent management,"“For example, if data points will be shown on a publicly available map, it is critical that the participants understand and consent to this, as observations taken and shared may reveal home locations or other personal details, even if their user ID is anonymized.” (Luna et al., 2018, p. 16)"
Secure-by-design without breaking workflows,"""Implementing high-security features like end-to-end encryption can make a documentation tool difficult to use, which can result in unwanted outcomes such as security features being subverted, or the tool not being adopted at all."" (PLIPG et al. 2020, 53)"
Transparent hosting options and data-residency controls,"“If your data will be sent to a remote location, be aware of which countries the data will reside. How vulnerable is data to being exposed in those countries, whether by court orders or other means? What risks do you face by having your data exposed there?” (“Should I Use This Documentation App?”, p. 6)"
